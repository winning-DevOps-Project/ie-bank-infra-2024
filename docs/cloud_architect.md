## **12-Factor App Design**

### **Overview**  
The 12-Factor App methodology provides a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable cloud-native applications. The IE Bank MVP adheres to these principles to ensure reliability, scalability, and ease of deployment across environments. Below is how each of the 12 factors is applied in the design and implementation of the product.

### Main Takeaways:
1. **Scalability**:  
   - Horizontal scaling and seamless transitions between environments are built into the architecture.  

2. **Maintainability**:  
   - Clear separation of concerns simplifies debugging, onboarding, and ongoing application updates.  

3. **Resilience**:  
   - Stateless processes and decoupled services ensure robust failover and recovery mechanisms.  

---

### **1. Codebase**  
**A single codebase tracked in version control, with multiple deployments.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Two GitHub repositories host the code: one for the frontend (Vue.js) and one for the backend (Python Flask).  
  - Modularized infrastructure code is stored in a separate repository, leveraging Azure Bicep.  
  - Branching strategy: Feature branches for development; `main` branch for production deployments.  

---

### **2. Dependencies**  
**Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Backend dependencies are declared in `requirements.txt` and managed using `pip`.  
  - Frontend dependencies are specified in `package.json` and managed via `npm`.  
  - Docker ensures isolated environments with consistent dependencies for development and deployment.  

---

### **3. Configuration**  
**Store configuration in the environment, not in the code.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Sensitive credentials (e.g., database connections, API keys) are securely managed using **Azure Key Vault**.  
  - Environment-specific configurations are defined in **Bicep parameter files**.  
  - Application settings, such as UAT vs. Production, are managed via **Azure App Service settings**.  

---

### **4. Backing Services**  
**Treat backing services (e.g., databases, queues) as attached resources.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - PostgreSQL is provisioned as a managed Azure service.  
  - Database credentials and secrets for external services are securely stored in **Key Vault**.  
  - Backend dynamically connects to resources based on environment-specific settings.  

---

### **5. Build, Release, Run**  
**Separate the build and run stages for deployment.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - **Build**: CI pipelines create Docker images for the frontend and backend.  
  - **Release**: Artifacts are deployed to UAT for validation before production deployment.  
  - **Run**: Production deployments are triggered automatically after successful UAT validation.  

---

### **6. Processes**  
**Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Backend processes are stateless, with session data persisted in PostgreSQL.  
  - Frontend interacts dynamically through APIs, with no local state storage.  

---

### **7. Port Binding**  
**Expose services via port binding.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Backend is hosted on Azure App Services, exposing HTTP endpoints.  
  - Frontend is served via Azure Static Web Apps, communicating with the backend using RESTful APIs.  

---

### **8. Concurrency**  
**Scale out via the process model.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Autoscaling is enabled for both the backend App Service and PostgreSQL database in Production.  
  - Azureâ€™s built-in load balancer ensures support for concurrent requests without manual intervention.  

---

### **9. Disposability**  
**Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Dockerized applications ensure fast and consistent startups across environments.  
  - Graceful shutdown mechanisms protect active requests during service termination.  

---

### **10. Dev/Prod Parity**  
**Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - DTAP (Development, Test, Acceptance, Production) environments are provisioned using the same **Bicep templates** to ensure consistency.  
  - Monitoring and telemetry are managed uniformly across all environments using **Application Insights** and **Log Analytics Workspace**.  

---

### **11. Logs**  
**Treat logs as event streams.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Logs from applications and infrastructure are centralized in **Log Analytics Workspace**.  
  - Performance and error telemetry for frontend and backend are captured using **Application Insights**.  

---

### **12. Admin Processes**  
**Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.**  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Database migrations are run as one-off commands during CI/CD pipeline executions.  
  - Monitoring and incident response tasks are automated using **Azure CLI** and custom scripts.  

---

### **Summary**

By aligning with the **12-Factor App principles**, the IE Bank MVP adopts a cloud-native design optimized for modern application development. These practices ensure scalability, maintainability, and operational efficiency, providing a solid foundation for continuous integration and delivery.
