# Service Level Agreement (SLA) 

## **Purpose**
This SLA defines the performance, availability, and reliability commitments of the DevOpps system. It outlines the agreed-upon metrics and responsibilities to ensure the system's effective operation.

---

## **Scope**
This SLA applies to the following services and components in the production environment:
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure PostgreSQL Server and Database
- Azure App Service (Backend)
- Azure Static Web App
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Application Insights
- Azure Logic App (for Slack notifications)

2. **Escalation Timeframe**:
   - Escalate unresolved issues to the next support level within 1 hour.
3. **Incident Resolution Time**:
   - Critical: Resolved within 4 hours.
   - Moderate: Resolved within 8 hours.
   - Low: Resolved within 24 hours.

---

## **Performance Measurement**
Metrics will be measured monthly using Azureâ€™s built-in monitoring and reporting tools. If any SLA is not met, an RCA (Root Cause Analysis) will be conducted to address the issue.

---

## **Review and Revision**
This SLA will be reviewed quarterly to ensure it remains relevant and accurate. Any updates will be communicated to stakeholders.

---

## **Exclusions**
